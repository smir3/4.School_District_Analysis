# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to assist school board superintendents in making school and district level decisions regarding school's budgets and priorities. I will assist Maria, the Chief Data Scientist for a City School District, in aggregating and analyzing data on student funding and student's standardized test scores as well as showcasing trends on school performance. 

During this analysis, Maria asked me to replace the ninth graders' math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs (an undefined number) due to evidence of academic dishonesty. 

Task Deliverables: The goal of this analysis is to report a School District Analysis which includes:
- a district summary
- a school summary
- the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools
- the average math score for each grade level from each school
- the average reading score for each grade level from each school
- the scores by school spending per student, by school size, and by school type. 

Also, this analysis will examine how replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affected the School District Analysis.
