# School_District_Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

Purpose: Maria Chief Data Scientist for a city school district is responsible for analyzing information from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats. In this role she is tasked with preparing all standardized tast data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights on performance trends and patterns. These insights are used to inform discussions and strategic decisions on the school and district level. I am tasked with helping Maria on analyzing data on student funding and student's standardized test scores. Will be given access to every students math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I have to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will assist the school board superintendents in making decisions regarding the school's budgets and priorities. 

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked you to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once you’ve replaced the math and reading scores, Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
